# Quick-Draw-Image-Classification-Challenge
This repository contains the solution for a deep learning image classification challenge undertaken as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning module at the engineering school ISIMA.

The objective of this challenge is to propose a classification method based on neural networks for classifying images from Google Quickdraw <link>https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data</link>. The provided dataset consists of 5 balanced classes, with 15,000 training examples and 5,000 validation examples: baskets, eyes, glasses, rabbits, and hands.
